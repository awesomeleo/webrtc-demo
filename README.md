WebRTC Demo
============

A webRTC demo using XMPP-FTW to do the signalling over XMPP.

All files live in the `gh-pages` branch.

See also https://github.com/legastero/jingle-interop-demos for great work from [fippo](github.com/fippo) and [legastero](github.com/legastero) from which this work derives.

This demo should be available here: http://xmpp-ftw.github.io/webrtc-demo. 

[Note: you will be pushing your password over HTTP - maybe use a test account or anonymous login].
